- ` Node.js `: A server-side runtime that allows running JavaScript on the backend.
- ` Express.js `: A lightweight web framework for Node.js used to create server-side APIs and handle HTTP requests.
- ` MongoDB ` : A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
- ` Socket.io ` : A real-time communication library that enables bidirectional, event-based interactions between clients and servers.
- ` Tailwind-CSS` : A utility-first CSS framework for building custom, responsive designs quickly by composing classes directly in HTML.
